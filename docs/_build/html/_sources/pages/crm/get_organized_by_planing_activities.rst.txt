Get organized by planning activities

Planning activities is the perfect way to keep on track with your work. Get reminded of what needs to be done and schedule the next activities to undertake.

Your activities are available wherever you are in Odoo. It is easy to manage your priorities.

Set your activity types
************************
A number of generic activities types are available by default in Odoo (e.g. call, email, meeting, etc.). If you would like to set new ones, go to Settings ‣ General settings ‣ Activity types.

Schedule meetings
*****************
Activities are planned for specific days. If you need to set hours, go with the Meeting activity type. When scheduling one, the calendar will simply open to let you select a time slot.

.. tip::  If you need to use other activity types with a calendar planning, make sure their Category is set as Meeting.
